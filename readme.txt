TEAMWW for Project-2

Descpritions:
	
	In our project-2, we have used the item-shop Api. We have created this APi in a RESTful to allow the http request and response with the item's and user's (name and price) endpoints. we have used a docker to create container image and pushed into dockerhub.
For this project, we have use Jenkins to deploy the application to the (AWS)EKS cluster using CI/CD(continous Delivery) where we have to provide authorization at the end of the deployment process. Also, We have used a Grafana for the metrics and logs visualization which will be collected from Prometheus and loki. Also, we have used sonarcloud to catch Bugs and Security Vulnerabilities in your Pull Requests.
